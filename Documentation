Project Introduction: 
For this project, we wanted to build a room quality calculator that would measure the temperature, the humidity and the light in a room for a certain period of time. 
The users would only need to click on the button to start the process and click again to stop it. This project will be using temperature sensore and light sensor and store all the data in mongo. 
As for our main Target audience, its mostly homeowners, real estate, construction, physical goods collectors, exotic pet owners. but it can be used by really anyone

We used different hardware in the schematic due to the pin configuration not matching our 
actual sensors, the corresponding sensors are next to the sensors on the board. The same is 
applicable to our Arduino due to our specific board not being available on Fritzing

Sensors used: Temperature sensor, Photocell Sensor
